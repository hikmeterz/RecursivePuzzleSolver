# RecursivePuzzleSolver

# Description
RecursivePuzzleSolver is a Java application designed to determine if a path can be successfully navigated through an array using recursive steps. The user inputs an array of integers where each number determines how many steps forward or backward can be taken from the current position. The goal is to see if it's possible to reach the end of the array starting from a user-specified point.

# Features

Takes a user-inputted array of integers and a starting point.
Utilizes recursion to explore all possible paths from the starting point.
Determines if a valid path exists that allows reaching the end of the array.
